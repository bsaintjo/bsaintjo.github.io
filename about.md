I am recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz from the Department of Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics Department. Prior to that I completed by B.S. in Chemistry with a specialization in Biochemistry at the University of Virginia.

This blog contains writing about things I've learned and things I'm learning. I hope you find it useful.
